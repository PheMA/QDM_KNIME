                  <div style="width:660px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:auto"><pre>1. Scientific basis for measuring visual acuity outcomes after cataract surgery&#xD;
The only reason to perform cataract surgery (other than for a limited set of medical indications) is to improve a patient&#8217;s vision and associated functioning. The use of a 20/40 visual acuity threshold is based on several considerations. First, it is the level for unrestricted operation of a motor vehicle in the US. Second, it has been consistently used by the FDA in its assessment for approval of intraocular lens (IOL) and other vision devices. Third, it is the literature standard to denote success in cataract surgery. Fourth, work by West et al in the Salisbury Eye Study suggests that 20/40 is a useful threshold for 50th percentile functioning for several vision-related tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
Most patients achieve excellent visual acuity after cataract surgery (20/40 or better). This outcome is achieved consistently through careful attention through the accurate measurement of axial length and corneal power and the appropriate selection of an IOL power calculation formula. As such, it reflects the care and diligence with which the surgery is assessed, planned and executed. Failure to achieve this after surgery in eyes without comorbid ocular conditions that would impact the success of the surgery would reflect care that should be assessed for opportunities for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
The exclusion of patients with other ocular and systemic conditions known to increase the risk of an adverse outcome reflects the findings of the two published prediction rule papers for cataract surgery outcomes, by Mangione et al and Steinberg et al. In both papers, the presence of comorbid glaucoma and macular degeneration negatively impacted the likelihood of successful outcomes of surgery. Further, as noted in the prior indicator, exclusion of eyes with ocular conditions that could impact the success of the surgery would NOT eliminate the large majority of eyes undergoing surgery while also minimizing the potential adverse selection that might otherwise occur relative to those patients with the most complex situations who might benefit the most from having surgery to maximize their remaining vision. &#xD;
&#xD;
2. Evidence of a gap in care&#xD;
This is an outcome of surgery indicator of direct relevance to patients and referring providers. The available evidence suggests that cataract surgery achieves this in between 86 and 98% of surgeries in eyes without comorbid ocular conditions (this indicator). While small, the volume of cataract surgery in the US of over 2.8 million surgeries suggests that the impact could affect more than 100,000 patients per year. Because of the exclusion of comorbid ocular conditions, one would expect performance on this indicator to be as high as possible, with significantly lower rates suggestive of opportunities for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ASCRS National Cataract Database reported that at 3 months postoperatively, 85.5% of all patients had a 20/40 or better best-corrected visual acuity, 57.2% of patients had 20/25 or better postoperative best-corrected visual acuity, and 74.6% of patients were within +/- 1.0 D of target spherical equivalent. Based on 5,788 responses, the mean visual function index score at 3 months postoperatively was 70.3% compared with 55.0% preoperatively. (The score is based on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 indicating an inability to perform any of the activities.) The European Cataract Outcome Study reported for 1999 that 89% of patients achieved a postoperative visual acuity of 0.5 or more (20/40 or better), the average induced astigmatism was 0.59 D, and 86% of patients had an induced astigmatism within +/- 1.0 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
The AAO National Eyecare Outcomes Network (NEON) database also found similar rates of success, with an improvement in visual acuity in 92.2% of patients and improvement in VF-14 in over 90% of patients. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 was achieved by 89% of all NEON patients and 96% of NEON patients without preoperative ocular comorbid conditions. Seventy-eight percent of patients were within +/-1.0 D of target spherical equivalent. Ninety-five percent of patients reported being satisfied with the results of their surgery. Patients who were dissatisfied with the results of their surgery were slightly older and more likely to have ocular comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
In studies of phacoemulsification cataract surgery performed by ophthalmology residents, the reported range of patients with postoperative BCVA of 20/40 or better is 80% to 91%. If eyes with ocular comorbidities are excluded, the reported range of patients with postoperative BCVA of 20/40 or better is 86% to 98%. (AAO, 2011)</pre></div>

The level of analysis for this measure is each cataract surgery during the measurement period, including instances where more than one cataract procedure was performed during the measurement period. Every cataract surgery during the measurement period should be counted as a measurable denominator event for the measure calculation.&#xD;
 &#xD;
Only procedures performed during January 1 &#8211; September 30 of the reporting period will be considered for this measure, in order to determine if 20/40 or better visual acuity has been achieved within the 90 days following the cataract procedure. Cataract procedures performed during October 1 &#8211; December 31 are excluded from the initial patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
The measure, as written, does not specifically require documentation of laterality. Coding limitations in particular clinical terminologies do not currently allow for that level of specificity (ICD-10-CM includes laterality, but ICD-9-CM and SNOMED-CT do not uniformly include this distinction). Therefore, at this time, it is not a requirement of this measure to indicate laterality of the diagnoses, findings or procedures. Available coding to capture the data elements specified in this measure has been provided. It is assumed that the eligible professional will record laterality in the patient medical record, as quality care and clinical documentation should include laterality.</pre></div>
