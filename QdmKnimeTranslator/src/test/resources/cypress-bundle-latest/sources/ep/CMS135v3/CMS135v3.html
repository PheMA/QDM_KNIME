&#xD;
Treatment with an [ACE inhibitor] should be initiated at low doses [see excerpt from guideline table below], followed by gradual increments in dose if lower doses have been well tolerated. Clinicians should attempt to use doses that have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in clinical trials. If these target doses of an [ACE inhibitor] cannot be used or are poorly tolerated, intermediate doses should be used with the expectation that there are likely to be only small differences in efficacy between low and high doses.

&#xD;
**[Note: Among ARBs, Losartan has the weakest evidence supporting its value in heart failure patients.] Additionally, while the 2009 guidelines recommended a maximum dosage of 100mg, the maximum dosage recommendation for Losartan has been increased to 150mg based on the HEAAL trial. (Konstam MA, et al. Lancet 2009 Nov 28;374:1840-8)&#xD;
&#xD;
An ARB should be administered to post-[myocardial infarction (MI)] patients without [heart failure] who are intolerant of [ACE inhibitors] and have a low LVEF. (Class I, Level of Evidence: B) (ACCF/AHA, 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
Angiotensin II receptor blockers are reasonable to use as alternatives to [ACE inhibitors] as first-line therapy for patients with mild to moderate [heart failure] and reduced LVEF, especially for patients already taking ARBs for other indications. (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: A) (ACCF/AHA, 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
For the hospitalized patient:&#xD;
--In patients with reduced ejection fraction experiencing a symptomatic exacerbation of [heart failure] requiring hospitalization during chronic maintenance treatment with oral therapies known to improve outcomes, particularly ACE inhibitors or ARBs and beta-blocker therapy, it is recommended that these therapies be continued in most patients in the absence of hemodynamic instability or contraindications. (Class I, Level of Evidence: C) (ACCF/AHA, 2009)&#xD;
--In patients hospitalized with [heart failure] with reduced ejection fraction not treated with oral therapies known to improve outcomes, particularly ACE inhibitors or ARBs and beta-blocker therapy, initiation of these therapies is recommended in stable patients prior to hospital discharge. Initiation of beta-blocker therapy is recommended after optimization of volume status and successful discontinuation of intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents. Beta-blocker therapy should be initiated at a low dose and only in stable patients. Particular caution should be used when initiating beta-blockers in patients who have required inotropes during their hospital course. (Class I, Level of Evidence: B) (ACCF/AHA, 2009)</pre></div>
