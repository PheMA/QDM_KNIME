                  <div style="width:660px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:auto"><pre>The World Health Organization (WHO), as seen in Pratt &amp; Brody (2008), found that major depression was the leading cause of disability worldwide. Depression causes suffering, decreases quality of life, and causes impairment in social and occupational functioning. It is associated with increased health care costs as well as with higher rates of many chronic medical conditions. Studies have shown that a higher number of depression symptoms are associated with poor health and impaired functioning, whether or not the criteria for a diagnosis of major depression are met. Persons 40-59 years of age had higher rates of depression than any other age group. Persons 12-17, 18-39 and 60 years of age and older had similar rates of depression. Depression was more common in females than in males. Non-Hispanic Black persons had higher rates of depression than non-Hispanic White persons. In the 18-39 and 40-59 age groups, those with income below the federal poverty level had higher rates of depression than those with higher income. Among persons 12-17 and 60 years of age and older, rates of depression did not vary significantly by poverty status. &#xD;
&#xD;
Overall, approximately 80% of persons with depression reported some level of difficulty in functioning because of their depressive symptoms. In addition, 35% of males and 22% of females with depression reported that their depressive symptoms make it very or extremely difficult for them to work, get things done at home, or get along with other people. More than one-half of all persons with mild depressive symptoms also reported some difficulty in daily functioning attributable to their symptoms. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
15&#8211;20 percent of adults older than age 65 in the United States have experienced depression (Geriatric Mental Health Foundation, 2008). 7 million adults aged 65 years and older are affected by depression (Steinman, 2007). Chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries with accompanying depression have significantly higher health care costs than those with chronic diseases alone (Unutzer, 2009). People aged 65 years and older accounted for 16 percent of suicide deaths in 2004 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The negative outcomes associated with early onset depression, make it crucial to identify and treat depression in its early stages. As reported in Borner et al. (2010), a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in North America, primary care and family physicians are likely to provide the first line of treatment for depressive disorders. Others consistently report a 10% prevalence rate of depression in primary care patients. But studies have shown that primary care physicians fail to recognize up to 50% of depressed patients, purportedly because of time constraints and a lack of brief, sensitive, easy-to administer psychiatric screening instruments. Coyle et al. (2003), suggested that the picture is more grim for adolescents, and that more than 70% of children and adolescents suffering from serious mood disorders, go unrecognized or inadequately treated.  Healthy People 2020 recommends routine screening for mental health problems as a part of primary care for both children and adults (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2014).   &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating condition that has been increasingly recognized among youth, particularly adolescents. The prevalence of current or recent depression among children is 3% and among adolescents is 6%. The lifetime prevalence of MDD among adolescents may be as high as 20%. Adolescent-onset MDD is associated with an increased risk of death by suicide, suicide attempts, and recurrence of major depression by young adulthood. MDD is also associated with early pregnancy, decreased school performance, and impaired work, social, and family functioning during young adulthood (Williams et al., 2009). Every fifth adolescent may have a history of depression by age 18. The increase in the onset of depression occurs around puberty. According to Zalsman et al. (2006), as reported in Borner et al. (2010), depression ranks among the most commonly reported mental health problems in adolescent girls. &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
The economic burden of depression is substantial for individuals as well as society. Costs to an individual may include suffering, possible side effects from treatment, fees for mental health and medical visits and medications, time away from work and lost wages, transportation, and reduced quality of personal relationships. Costs to society may include loss of life, reduced productivity (because of both diminished capacity while at work and absenteeism from work), and increased costs of mental health and medical care. In 2000, the United States spent an estimated $83.1 billion in direct and indirect costs of depression (USPSTF, 2009).</pre></div>

                  <div style="width:660px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:auto"><pre>Adolescent Recommendation (12-18 years):&#xD;
&#xD;
The USPSTF recommends screening of adolescents (12-18 years of age), for major depressive disorder (MDD) when systems are in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, psychotherapy (cognitive-behavioral or interpersonal), and follow-up (AHRQ, 2010, p.141).&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Clinicians and health care systems should try to consistently screen adolescents, ages 12-18,  for major depressive disorder, but only when systems are in place to ensure accurate diagnosis, careful selection of treatment, and close follow-up (ICSI, 2013, p. 16).&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
Adult Recommendation (18 years and older):&#xD;
&#xD;
The USPSTF recommends screening adults for depression when staff-assisted depression care supports are in place to assure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and follow-up (AHRQ, 2010, p.136). &#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
&#xD;
A system that has embedded the elements of best practice and has capacity to effectively manage the volume, should consider routine screening of all patients based on the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (ICSI, 2013, p. 7). Clinicians should use a standardized instrument to screen for depression if it is suspected, based on risk factors or presentation. Clinicians should assess and treat for depression in patients with some comorbidities. Clinicians should acknowledge the impact of culture and cultural differences on physician and mental health. Clinicians should screen and monitor depression in pregnant and post-partum women (ICSI, 2013, p. 4).</pre></div>
