In this measure, the active drug ingredient is warfarin. The number of active days of an occurrence of a medication (e.g., a medication order or an entry in a patient's medication list) is calculated by taking the difference (in calendar days) between the date that the medication became active and the date that the medication stopped being active. The cumulative medication duration is calculated as the sum of the number of active calendar days for each occurrence of a medication that contains the same active ingredient over a set period of time, excluding any gaps during which a medication was not active. All of the entries in the value set for warfarin (OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.3.117.1.7.1.232) must be included in determining the cumulative medication duration. All medication occurrences considered for the calculation of cumulative medication duration for this measure must be active within 200 days immediately prior to the measurement period. This lookback period of 200 days is based on the original warfarin TTR measure used by the Veterans Affairs health care system. Please refer to the supplemental file named “CMS179v2_Supplemental_SQL_Logic_Reference.pdf” for this logic.\r\n\r\nA VALID INR INTERVAL is two INR values separated by 56 days or less. INR values must be obtained in outpatient care settings; INR values while the patient is admitted to a hospital for more than 23 hours should not be included.\r\n\r\nTHERAPEUTIC RANGE: for patients with atrial fibrillation and no valvular involvement, the target INR result = 2.0 – 3.0.\r\n\r\nPERCENT OF TIME IN THERAPEUTIC RANGE (TTR) is the percentage of time during which the interpolated INR values lie between 2.0 and 3.0. This can be from 0% to 100%. TTR percentage should be calculated for each patient that meets the criteria for the Measure Population. The average of these values is reported as the Measure Observation. The calculation for TTR is provided in the supplemental file named “CMS179v2 _Supplemental_SQL_Logic_Reference.pdf”.\r\n\r\nINTERPOLATED INR VALUES are obtained through the use of linear interpolation to assign an INR value to each day between successive observed INR values.

In this measure, the active drug ingredient is warfarin. The number of active days of an occurrence of a medication (e.g., a medication order or an entry in a patient's medication list) is calculated by taking the difference (in calendar days) between the date that the medication became active and the date that the medication stopped being active. The cumulative medication duration is calculated as the sum of the number of active calendar days for each occurrence of a medication that contains the same active ingredient over a set period of time, excluding any gaps during which a medication was not active. All of the entries in the value set for warfarin (OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.3.117.1.7.1.232) must be included in determining the cumulative medication duration. All medication occurrences considered for the calculation of cumulative medication duration for this measure must be active within 200 days immediately prior to the measurement period. This lookback period of 200 days is based on the original warfarin TTR measure used by the Veterans Affairs health care system. Please refer to the supplemental file named “CMS179v2_Supplemental_SQL_Logic_Reference.pdf” for this logic.\r\n\r\nA VALID INR INTERVAL is two INR values separated by 56 days or less. INR values must be obtained in outpatient care settings; INR values while the patient is admitted to a hospital for more than 23 hours should not be included.\r\n\r\nTHERAPEUTIC RANGE: for patients with atrial fibrillation and no valvular involvement, the target INR result = 2.0 – 3.0.\r\n\r\nPERCENT OF TIME IN THERAPEUTIC RANGE (TTR) is the percentage of time during which the interpolated INR values lie between 2.0 and 3.0. This can be from 0% to 100%. TTR percentage should be calculated for each patient that meets the criteria for the Measure Population. The average of these values is reported as the Measure Observation. The calculation for TTR is provided in the supplemental file named “CMS179v2 _Supplemental_SQL_Logic_Reference.pdf”.\r\n\r\nINTERPOLATED INR VALUES are obtained through the use of linear interpolation to assign an INR value to each day between successive observed INR values. The Rosendaal linear interpolation methodology used in this measure assumes a linear relationship between two INR values and allows the assignment of a specific INR to each day for each patient.",
