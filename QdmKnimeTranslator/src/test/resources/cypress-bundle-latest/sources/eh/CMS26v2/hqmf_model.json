      "value": "Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and a major cause of morbidity and health care costs nationally (Adams, et al., 2001). In 2005, 5.2% of children with asthma had at least one asthma attack in the previous year (3.8 million children). Nearly two of every three children who currently have asthma had at least one attack in the past 12 months. Chronic asthma in children can account for an annual loss of more than 14 million school days per year, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation (Asthma Facts and Figures).\n\nIt is clear from multiple sources of evidence including the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Guidelines that actual self-management of asthma by the patient or caregiver leads to more positive outcomes. Appropriate self-management is completely reliant upon patient education. Patient education is more effective when it aims at training self-management skills that will alter behavior (Norris, et al., 2001).\n\nNHLBI notes that review of asthma management by expert clinicians is necessary but not sufficient to improve outcomes. Active learning, participating and verbalization of understanding are all strategies that a healthcare organization must incorporate with parents or caregivers of asthmatic children in order for them to understand and make the appropriate changes that can impact the disease in the child in question. Education programs have been effective in improving lung function, feelings of self-esteem, and consequently decreased missed days of school in children and adolescents (Phipatanakul, 2004). Acute hospitalization follow up is imperative to a successful discharge from the hospital, providing the caretaker with the resource information needed to contact the follow up facility, medical office or clinic setting (Schatz, et al, 2009).\n\nEnvironmental control consists of removal of asthma triggers from the environment. Multiple studies support the positive correlation of household maintenance factors such as control of cockroach dust, and the number of acute asthma attacks in asthmatic children (McConnell, et al, 2005 and Eggleston, et al., 2005). Evidence from Carter et al, (2001) supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) grant found specifically that reduction in triggers such as household conditions i.e. dust mites, cockroach, cats and presence of molds and fungus, resulted in a decrease in acute care visits and an overall positive outcome of children.\n\nRescue action education related to early recognition of symptoms and proper action to control incidence of asthma attacks is noted to have positive outcomes for asthmatic children (Ducharme and Bhogal, 2008).",

        "value": "Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and a major cause of morbidity and health care costs nationally (Adams, et al., 2001). In 2005, 5.2% of children with asthma had at least one asthma attack in the previous year (3.8 million children). Nearly two of every three children who currently have asthma had at least one attack in the past 12 months. Chronic asthma in children can account for an annual loss of more than 14 million school days per year, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation (Asthma Facts and Figures).\n\nIt is clear from multiple sources of evidence including the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Guidelines that actual self-management of asthma by the patient or caregiver leads to more positive outcomes. Appropriate self-management is completely reliant upon patient education. Patient education is more effective when it aims at training self-management skills that will alter behavior (Norris, et al., 2001).\n\nNHLBI notes that review of asthma management by expert clinicians is necessary but not sufficient to improve outcomes. Active learning, participating and verbalization of understanding are all strategies that a healthcare organization must incorporate with parents or caregivers of asthmatic children in order for them to understand and make the appropriate changes that can impact the disease in the child in question. Education programs have been effective in improving lung function, feelings of self-esteem, and consequently decreased missed days of school in children and adolescents (Phipatanakul, 2004). Acute hospitalization follow up is imperative to a successful discharge from the hospital, providing the caretaker with the resource information needed to contact the follow up facility, medical office or clinic setting (Schatz, et al, 2009).\n\nEnvironmental control consists of removal of asthma triggers from the environment. Multiple studies support the positive correlation of household maintenance factors such as control of cockroach dust, and the number of acute asthma attacks in asthmatic children (McConnell, et al, 2005 and Eggleston, et al., 2005). Evidence from Carter et al, (2001) supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) grant found specifically that reduction in triggers such as household conditions i.e. dust mites, cockroach, cats and presence of molds and fungus, resulted in a decrease in acute care visits and an overall positive outcome of children.\n\nRescue action education related to early recognition of symptoms and proper action to control incidence of asthma attacks is noted to have positive outcomes for asthmatic children (Ducharme and Bhogal, 2008).",
